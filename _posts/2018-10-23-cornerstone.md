### Cornerstone H5P Prototypes

WI+RE is working on a new look and some new interactive elements for the CCLE Cornerstone Research Workshop series!

Please try out the Cornerstone Workshops below and let us know what you think!

(If the activity looks out of proportion, you can fix it by making it full screen and shrinking it again.)
